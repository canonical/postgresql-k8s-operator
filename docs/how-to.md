# How-to guides

The following guides cover key processes and common tasks for managing and using Charmed PostgreSQL on Kubernetes.

## Deployment and setup

The following guides walk you through the details of how to install different cloud services and bootstrap them to Juju:
* [Canonical K8s]
* [MicroK8s]
* [GKE]
* [EKS]
* [AKS]
* [Multi-availability zones (AZ)][Multi-AZ]

The following guides cover some specific deployment scenarios and architectures:
* [Terraform]
* [Air-gapped]

## Usage and maintenance

* [Integrate with another application]
* [External access]
* [Scale replicas]
* [Enable TLS]
* [Enable plugins/extensions]

## Backup and restore
* [Configure S3 AWS]
* [Configure S3 RadosGW]
* [Create a backup]
* [Restore a backup]
* [Manage backup retention]
* [Migrate a cluster]

## Monitoring (COS)

* [Enable monitoring]
* [Enable alert rules]
* [Enable tracing]

## Minor upgrades
* [Perform a minor upgrade]
* [Perform a minor rollback]

## Cross-regional (cluster-cluster) async replication

* [Cross-regional async replication]
    * [Set up clusters]
    * [Integrate with a client app]
    * [Remove or recover a cluster]
    * [Enable plugins/extensions]

## Development

This section is aimed at charm developers looking to support PostgreSQL integrations with their charm.

* [Integrate with your charm]
* [Migrate data via pg_dump]
* [Migrate data via backup/restore]
