# How to migrate a cluster

This is a guide on how to restore a backup that was made from a different cluster, (i.e. cluster migration via restore). 

To perform a basic restore (from a *local* backup), see [How to restore a local backup](/)

## Prerequisites
Restoring a backup from a previous cluster to a current cluster requires:
- A single unit Charmed PostgreSQL deployed and running
- Access to S3 storage
- [Configured settings for S3 storage](/)
- Backups from the previous cluster in your S3 storage
- Passwords from your previous cluster

---

## Manage cluster passwords
When you restore a backup from an old cluster, it will restore the password from the previous cluster to your current cluster. Set the password of your current cluster to the previous cluster’s password:
```shell
juju run postgresql-k8s/leader set-password username=operator password=<previous cluster password>
juju run postgresql-k8s/leader set-password username=replication password=<previous cluster password> 
juju run postgresql-k8s/leader set-password username=rewind password=<previous cluster password>
```
## List backups
To view the available backups to restore, use the command `list-backups`:
```shell
juju run postgresql-k8s/leader list-backups
```
This shows a list of the available backups (it is up to you to identify which `backup-id` corresponds to the previous-cluster):
```shell
backups: 
      |backup-id           | backup-type  | backup-status
