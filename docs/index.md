# Charmed PostgreSQL K8s documentation

```{note}
This is a **Kubernetes** operator. To deploy on IAAS/VM, see [Charmed PostgreSQL VM](https://charmhub.io/postgresql).
```

Charmed PostgreSQL K8s is an open-source software operator designed to deploy and operate object-relational databases on Kubernetes. It packages the powerful database management system [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) into a charmed operator for deployment with [Juju](https://juju.is/docs/juju).

This charmed operator meets the need of simplifying deployment, scaling, configuration and management of relational databases in large-scale production environments reliably. It is equipped with several features to securely store and scale complicated data workloads, including easy integration with client applications.
 
Charmed PostgreSQL K8s is made for anyone looking for a comprehensive database management interface, whether for operating a complex production environment or simply as a playground to learn more about databases and charms.
