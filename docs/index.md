# Charmed PostgreSQL K8s documentation

> This is a **Kubernetes** operator. To deploy on IAAS/VM, see [Charmed PostgreSQL VM](https://charmhub.io/postgresql).

Charmed PostgreSQL K8s is an open-source operator designed to deploy and operate object-relational databases on IAAS/VM. It packages the powerful database management system [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) into a charmed operator for deployment with [Juju](https://juju.is/docs/juju).

This charm offers automated operations management from day 0 to day 2. It is equipped with several features to securely store and scale complicated data workloads, including TLS encryption, backups, monitoring, password rotation, and easy integration with client applications.

Charmed PostgreSQL K8s meets the need of deploying PostgreSQL in a structured and consistent manner while providing flexibility in configuration. It simplifies deployment, scaling, configuration and management of relational databases in large-scale production environments reliably.
 
This charmed operator is made for anyone looking for a comprehensive database management interface, whether for operating a complex production environment or simply as a playground to learn more about databases and charms.


<!--
This modern "Charmed PostgreSQL K8s" operator (in channel `14/stable`) is a new "[Charmed SDK](https://juju.is/docs/sdk)"-based charm that replaces the legacy "[Reactive](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/charm-taxonomy#reactive)"-based charm (in channel `latest/stable`).<br/>Read more about [legacy charms here](/explanation/legacy-charm).
