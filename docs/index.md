# Charmed PostgreSQL K8s documentation

```{caution}
**Charmed PostgreSQL K8s 16 is under development.** Please wait for the upcoming stable release before deploying it in production, or see the documentation for [version 14](https://canonical-charmed-postgresql-k8s.readthedocs-hosted.com/14/).

Meanwhile, you’re welcome to explore the [`16/edge` track](https://charmhub.io/postgresql-k8s?channel=16/edge) and share your feedback as we continue to improve.
```

Charmed PostgreSQL K8s is an open-source software operator designed to deploy and operate object-relational databases on Kubernetes. It packages the powerful database management system [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) into a charmed operator for deployment with [Juju](https://juju.is/docs/juju).

This charmed operator meets the need of simplifying deployment, scaling, configuration and management of relational databases in large-scale production environments reliably. It is equipped with several features to securely store and scale complicated data workloads, including easy integration with client applications.
 
Charmed PostgreSQL K8s is made for anyone looking for a comprehensive database management interface, whether for operating a complex production environment or simply as a playground to learn more about databases and charms.

```{note}
This is a **Kubernetes** operator. To deploy on IAAS/VM, see [Charmed PostgreSQL VM](https://canonical-charmed-postgresql.readthedocs-hosted.com/).
