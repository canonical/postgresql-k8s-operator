# Enable tracing

This guide contains the steps to enable tracing with [Grafana Tempo](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/) for your PostgreSQL K8s application. 

```{caution}
This is feature is in development. It is **not recommended** for production environments. 
```

## Prerequisites

Enabling tracing with Tempo requires that you:

- Have deployed a Charmed PostgreSQL K8s revision 292+
  - See [](/how-to/deploy/index)
- Have deployed a 'cos-lite' bundle from the `latest/edge` track in a Kubernetes environment
  - See [Getting started on MicroK8s](https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack/tutorials/install-microk8s)

## Deploy Tempo

First, switch to the Kubernetes controller where the COS model is deployed:

```text
juju switch <k8s_controller_name>:<cos_model_name>
```
Then, deploy the dependencies of Tempo following [this tutorial](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/tutorial-deploy-tempo-ha-on-top-of-cos-lite/15489). In particular, we would want to:
- Deploy the MinIO charm
- Deploy the s3 integrator charm
- Add a bucket in MinIO using a python script
- Configure s3 integrator with the MinIO credentials

Finally, deploy and integrate with Tempo HA in [a monolithic setup](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/tutorial-deploy-tempo-ha-on-top-of-cos-lite/15489).

## Offer interfaces

Next, offer interfaces for cross-model integrations from the model where Charmed PostgreSQL K8s is deployed.

To offer the Tempo integration, run

```text
juju offer <tempo_coordinator_k8s_application_name>:tracing
```

Then, switch to the Charmed PostgreSQL K8s model, find the offers, and integrate (relate) with them:

```text
juju switch <k8s_controller_name>:<postgresql_k8s_model_name>

juju find-offers <k8s_controller_name>:
```
```{tip}
Don't miss the "`:`" in the command above.
```

Below is a sample output where `k8s` is the K8s controller name and `cos` is the model where `cos-lite` and `tempo-k8s` are deployed:

```text
Store  URL                            Access  Interfaces
k8s    admin/cos.tempo                admin   tracing:tracing
```

Next, consume this offer so that it is reachable from the current model:

```text
juju consume k8s:admin/cos.tempo
```

## Consume interfaces

First, deploy [Grafana Agent K8s](https://charmhub.io/grafana-agent-k8s) from the `latest/edge` channel:

```text
juju deploy grafana-agent-k8s --channel latest-edge 
```

Then, integrate Grafana Agent K8s with the consumed interface from the previous section:

```text
juju integrate grafana-agent-k8s:tracing tempo:tracing
```

Finally, integrate Charmed PostgreSQL K8s with Grafana Agent K8s:

```text
juju integrate postgresql-k8s:tracing grafana-agent-k8s:tracing-provider
```

Wait until the model settles. The following is an example of the `juju status --relations` on the Charmed PostgreSQL model:

```text

```

```{note}
All traces are exported to Tempo using HTTP. Support for sending traces via HTTPS is an upcoming feature.
```

## View traces

After this is complete, the Tempo traces will be accessible from Grafana under the `Explore` section with `tempo-k8s` as the data source. You will be able to select `postgresql-k8s` as the `Service Name` under the `Search` tab to view traces belonging to Charmed PostgreSQL K8s.

Below is a screenshot demonstrating a Charmed PostgreSQL K8s trace:

Feel free to read through the [Tempo HA documentation](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/charmed-tempo-ha/15531) at your leisure to explore its deployment and its integrations.
