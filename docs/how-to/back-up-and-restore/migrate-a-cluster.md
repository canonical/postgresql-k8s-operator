# How to migrate a cluster

This is a guide on how to restore a backup that was made from a different cluster, (i.e. cluster migration via restore). 

To perform a basic restore (from a *local* backup), see [](/how-to/back-up-and-restore/restore-a-backup).

## Prerequisites

Restoring a backup from a previous cluster to a current cluster requires:
- A single unit Charmed PostgreSQL deployed and running
- Access to S3 storage
  - [](/how-to/back-up-and-restore/configure-s3-aws)
- Backups from the previous cluster in your S3 storage
- Passwords from your previous cluster


## Manage cluster passwords

When you restore a backup from an old cluster, it will restore the password from the previous cluster to your current cluster. Set the password of your current cluster to the previous cluster’s password:

```text
juju run postgresql-k8s/leader set-password username=operator password=<previous cluster password>
juju run postgresql-k8s/leader set-password username=replication password=<previous cluster password> 
juju run postgresql-k8s/leader set-password username=rewind password=<previous cluster password>
```

## List backups

To view the available backups to restore, use the command `list-backups`:

```text
juju run postgresql/leader list-backups 
```

This shows a list of the available backups (it is up to you to identify which `backup-id` corresponds to the previous-cluster):
```text
backups: |-
  backup-id             | backup-type  | backup-status
  ----------------------------------------------------
  YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ  | physical     | finished
```

## Restore backup
To restore your current cluster to the state of the previous cluster, run the `restore` command and pass the correct `backup-id` to the command:

 ```text
juju run postgresql-k8s/leader restore backup-id=YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ 
```

Your restore will then be in progress. Once it is complete, your current cluster will represent the state of the previous cluster.
