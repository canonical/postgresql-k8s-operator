# How to create and list backups

Creating and listing backups requires that you:
* [Have a cluster with at least three-nodes deployed](/t/charmed-postgresql-k8s-how-to-manage-units/9592?channel=edge)
* Access to S3 storage
* [Have configured settings for S3 storage](/t/charmed-postgresql-k8s-how-to-configure-s3/9595?channel=edge)

Once you have a three-node cluster that has configurations set for S3 storage, check that Charmed PostgreSQL is `active` and `idle` with `juju status`. Once Charmed PostgreSQL is `active` and `idle`, you can create your first backup with the `create-backup` command:
```
juju run-action postgresql-k8s/leader create-backup --wait
```

You can list your available, failed, and in progress backups by running the `list-backups` command:
```
juju run-action postgresql-k8s/leader list-backups --wait
```
