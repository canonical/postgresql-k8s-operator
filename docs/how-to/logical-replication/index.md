# Logical replication

Logical replication is a feature that allows replicating a subset of one PostgreSQL cluster data to another PostgreSQL cluster.

Under the hood, it uses the publication and subscriptions mechanisms from the [PostgreSQL logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/logical-replication.html) feature.
