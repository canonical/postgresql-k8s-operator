# Upgrade

This charm does not support in-place upgrades for major version changes, and there are currently no minor versions of Charmed PostgreSQL 16 to upgrade or rollback.

For minor version upgrades on Charmed PostgreSQL 14, see the [version 14 upgrades documentation](https://canonical-charmed-postgresql-k8s.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/14/how-to/upgrade/).

```{note}
We will soon publish a migration guide with instructions on how to change from PostgreSQL 14 to 16.
```
